# ✨ Myra
Myra is a multi purpose Discord bot written on top of a custom Discord API wrapper. My goal is it to make a free bot, aimed to replace all other bots.

This project started as an attempt to replace Mee6. It now features lots of useful features, a web dashboard and multi language support.

## Discontinued
The bot got will be discontinued start around march 2025. It started as a closed source project. This will change. The code which is not used in production will get published.

## Run it yourself!
To run a working instance of the bot, you need to run 2 repositories:
* [Bot](https://github.com/MyraBot/Myra) ✨
* [Dashboard](https://github.com/MyraBot/website-v3/tree/redesign) 🌐

I didn't compile the dependencies. So you will need to compile the following repositories yourself:
- [API Wrapper](https://github.com/MyraBot/diskord) 🔧
