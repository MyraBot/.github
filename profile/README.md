# âœ¨ Myra
Myra is a multi purpose Discord bot written on top of a custom Discord API wrapper. My goal is it to make a free bot, aimed to replace all other bots.

This project started as an attempt to replace Mee6. It now features lots of useful features, a web dashboard and multi language support.

## Discontinued
The bot got will be discontinued start around march 2025. It started as a closed source project. This will change. The code which is not used in production will get published.

## Working code structure
To run a working instance of the bot, you need to run 2 repositories:
* Bot
* Website (optional)
